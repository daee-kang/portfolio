                ParkInn was my senior design project at UNLV, as a whole, it was designed to be a 
                software as a service for business to manage parking lots, this would also allow 
                clients to view availability of parking lot spaces in real time.

            </div>

            <div className={styles.description}>
                {`
                Along with other small tasks, my main part of the project was to create a tool in 
                the site to allow owners to draw parking lots with labeled parking spots. I also
                created a serialization algorithm that allowed us to save the parking lot data in 
                a mongo database that would then be grabbed by our iOS app to be re-rendered.
