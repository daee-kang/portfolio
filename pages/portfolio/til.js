                A react website where I'd be able to write any notes on any new software development skills. This was also
                my first time working with a database in a personal project, I created the backend with nodejs, express and mongodb. 
                I also spent a lot of time with styling to make it responsive for any device.

                But it was super cool while it lasted ðŸª¦ ðŸª¦ ðŸª¦
