                I've making dives into mobile development for the past 2 years, starting with Swift to SwiftUI and I've been 
                mastering React Native as of recently. A lot of my projects in the past have been small tiny projects 
                with the purpose of helping me learn the frameworks but this has been an app that I have been working over the 
                past year. Poll.io is an a polling app that lets users query and vote for polls only around their geographical location.
                The foundation of this app is to inspire people to vote in their local communities.

                My best friend gave me this idea around the time of the presidential election of 2020 where voting really mattered. 
                I have been on and off the project due to the job searches but I am determined to have this app out in the hands of 
                users everywhere. I've created a prototype with a functional backend but I was stuck with design and the last progress
                on this app was hiring a UI/UX designer to help me bring this project to end. 
                `}

            <div className={styles.description}>
                {`
                So yeah, I have a working prototype but it's not the best looking right now ðŸ˜¬, but the final product will be coming out
                soon.
