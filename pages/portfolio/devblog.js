                This is a website built with next.js with the sole purpose of being my development
                blog. I spend a lot of my time looking at other people's posts about things they are doing
                or technologies they are learning and that inspired me that hey, I can create content like that
                too and maybe someone will see it.
                `}
            </div>

            <div className={styles.description}>
                {`
                I also wanted to learn next.js and really a development blog was the perfect example to
                use it for. I learned about SEO and content management as well, it's also been set up on
                netlify for continuous integration. It's also fast as heck.  
                `}
            </div>

            <div className={styles.description}>
                {`
                There's not a lot of content right now as I've been pretty busy with job searches and
                building my portfolio but I definitely plan to fill it in the future.  
                `}
